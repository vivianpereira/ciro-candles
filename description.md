Assignment details
You are free to reuse the code from your previous assignment, make any changes, or develop the pages again so long as they meet the previous assignment brief. Ideally, you may choose to reuse your previous work as it will save you time. Your solution must demonstrate:

The following dynamic pages (use SQLite):
customer landing page (to search for products and add to a shopping basket)
item detail page (to view additional item details)
shopping basket (to view/delete items)
checkout page (enter details, order completion).
A database with three tables:
Products
Orders
Order_Details.
You must develop code that is well-written with reasonable comments/documentation. Your code must implement HTML, Bootstrap, and Python Flask (with other Flask modules) only. JavaScript may optionally be used as well. Your code will be tested so there should be no unexpected dependencies.
